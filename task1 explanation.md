   - `add(x, y)`: Returns the sum of x and y.
   - `subtract(x, y)`: Returns the result of subtracting y from x.
   - `multiply(x, y)`: Returns the product of x and y.
   - `divide(x, y)`: Returns the result of dividing x by y. Handles division by zero.

### 2. User Input:
   - Takes user input for two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).

### 3. Menu Display:
   - Displays a menu for the user to choose the operation:
     1. Addition
     2. Subtraction
     3. Multiplication
     4. Division

### 4. Operation Selection:
   - Takes user input for the desired operation (`choice`).

### 5. Performing the Operation:
   - Uses conditional statements to execute the chosen operation and store the result in the 'result' variable.

### 6. Display Result:
   - Prints the result of the chosen operation.

**Note:** The script ensures that division by zero is handled appropriately, preventing errors.
